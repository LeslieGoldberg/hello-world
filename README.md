# hello-world
place for learning and thoughts re:github

I am a music educator looking to switch careers into the tech industry. 
I am enjoying learning how to code python and have also learned some HTML and SQL. 
I look forward to becoming a more self-directed learner.
I need more experience internalizing and speaking the lingo.
